# magickscript
MagickScript is a Magickal programming language based on JavaScript which utilizes JQuery functions. 
It is a hybrid digital and magickal system. Intentions, ingredients, energies, entities, can call be 
set as variables which are called upon in functions, which are analogous to magickal procedures which 
are replicated in the code for the function and which achieve a designated magickal result. 
The code replicates this by performing operations on the supplied variables. 
The operation of the code acts as a magical act itself, giving the act power. This can be done in any number of ways. 
It may set a certain element, which may represent a specific area, to something which represents the magical intention. 
The only limits are the imagination and what you can do with code. The code may act as a structure which represents the
ritual and gives it direction, but the combination of the computational arrangement of symbolical elements becomes much 
stronger when an actual magickal act relating to the content within is achieved by executing said code. 
MagickScript can act as an organizational system for already existing sites. 

This document and accompanying ones contain the magickal DNA of MagickScript and makes it available to code which pulls them in.
