var magickScript = "MagickScript is a Magickal programming language based on JavaScript which utilizes JQuery functions." +
"It is a hybrid digital and magickal system. Intentions, ingredients, energies, entities, can call be set as variables" +
"which are called upon in functions, which are analogous to magickal procedures which are replicated in the code" +
"for the function and which achieve a designated magickal result. The code replicates this by performing operations" +
"on the supplied variables. The operation of the code acts as a magical act itself, giving the act power." +
"This can be done in any number of ways. It may set a certain element, which may represent a specific area," +
"to somethign which represents the magical intention. The only limits are the imagination and what you can do" +
"with code. The code may just as a structure which represents the ritual and gives it direction, but the" +
"combination of the computational arrangement of symbolical elements becomes much stronger when an actual magick" +
"act relating to the content within is achieved by executing said code. MagickScript can act as an organizational" +
"system for already existing sites. This document and accompanying ones contain the magickal DNA of MagickScript and makes it available to" +
"files which pull them will have access to the library."

//Definitions
var variableDefinition = "Anything taken as an input or output in the magickal operation." +
"Can be taken as an argument of a function or be set from its result or as part of its workings." +
"Also can be a useful way of storing information and keeping it current.";

var classDefinition = "A descriptor of variables. Can be used to group objects together to perform operations." +
"Often relates to variables that accomplish a specific goal or relate to a specific function or that should be" +
"styled together";

var tagDefinition = "A grouping of tags by subject matter. Correspond to major long term projests and each may have" +
"their own HTML file. Used to group classes in MagickScript interfaces.";

var eventDefinition = "Something that acts as a trigger for the function/magickal operation. The language listens" +
"for the event and triggers the function when it detects it."

var methodDefinition = "Functions built into MagickScript, can be quite flexible. See methods.js for library."

var functionDefinition = "Process by which an operation is completed. Result of function often relates to specific" +
"output wanted or variables to be set. Can take arguments which are processed by the function."

//Explanations of use of HTML and CSS files:
var htmlEx = "HTML can be used to build actual rendering digital styles that are triggered" +
"when the code is run. It can also be used in a more abstract way to structure ideas, plans and projects."

var cssEx = "CSS is used to describe and style classes and elements. These may be tied to those desingated in HTML or" +
"they can stand alone. Classes can be easily called in MagickScript and can be very useful for designating certain" +
"points of focus or initiatives. Classes are grouped into tags which represent a smaller number of large" +
"long-term areas of development and focus. Properties can be set on selected classes or elements, a list of properties" +
"developed so far can be found in 'styles/methods.css'"
